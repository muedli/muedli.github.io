#+TITLE: A Brief Intro to Literate Programming

* What is literate programming?

Literate programming is a way to make computer programs more easily digestible.
What does that mean? It means that a literate program includes source code as
well as a natural language explanation of the source code. At this point you
might be wondering if a literate program is just a program with lots of
comments. It's not. In a literate program, you might also have links, images,
nicely rendered mathematical formulas, and so on. Tools for literate programming
should make it easy to fiddle with the source code and execute it. It might be
easier to show than to tell.

* Example

In this example, we use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic][Euler's Polyhedron Formula]] to get the number of edges of
a cube. (A cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces.)

#+NAME: A cube with its vertices, edges, and faces labeled.
[[file:../images/cube.jpeg]]

Euler's Polyhedron Formula is \( V - E + F = 2. \) The \( V \) denotes the
number of vertices, the \( E \) denotes the number of edges, and the \( F \)
denotes the number of faces of a convex polyhedron. In the following program we
rearrange Euler's Polyhedron Formula to solve for \( E. \) The top function
returns \( E = V + F - 2. \) The bottom function calls the top function with \(
8 \) and \( 6 \) as parameters.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <iostream>

int getNumberOfEdges(int vertices, int faces) {
    return vertices + faces - 2;
}

int main() {
    int edgesOfCube = getNumberOfEdges(8, 6);
    std::cout << edgesOfCube << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 12

* My Favorite Tools for Literate Programming

There are many tools for literate programming. Two of my favorites are [[https://orgmode.org/][Emacs
Org-mode]] and [[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/][R Markdown]]. I actually made this webpage using Org-mode. It's
powerful. I haven't scratched its surface. As of this writing, it supports 42
programming languages. R Markdown only works with R, Python, and SQL as of this
writing, but it has some neat export options.
