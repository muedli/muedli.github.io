<h1>Salutations.</h1>

<p>
My name is Liam, and unfortunately for you, you've stumbled upon my homepage.
What follows is an unnecessarily long and self-indulgent professional bio, so
if you're not interested in that (understandable), go ahead and check out
my blog, projects, resume, or say hello using the contact page.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>
After an interesting childhood and adolescence, I decided to heed societal
expectations and get a post-secondary education. I enrolled at my local
community college and began working toward a degree in biology.  As part of
the biology curriculum there I had to take one semester of physics.  My
physics professor was truly great, and I was hooked. I changed my major and
signed up for the second semester.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I had to transfer to a four-year school. I ended up going to CU
Boulder to study physics because their financial aid package was the best. 
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>
My first foray into the world of non-everyday computing was using LaTeX
(all hail Donald Knuth) to typeset my community college physics homework.
At first I was using Microsoft Word's god-awful equation editor and I knew
there had to be a better way. I used the Google machine to find LaTeX and I
never looked back.
</p>

<p>
My first baby step into the world of programming was learning to use Vim
to make TeX files instead of using the built-in GUI editor that comes with
MacTeX.
</p>

<p>
Vim led me down several rabbit holes. The most time-consuming rabbit hole Vim
led me down was the Linux rabbit hole. I've been farting around with Linux
distributions for a few years now. I've recently fallen into the Emacs rabbit
hole. (I know; this is sacrilege for a Vim user.) I've also recently started
programming in earnest. I work at it every day.
</p>

<h2>Math</h2>

<p>
As I was studying physics at CU, I became increasingly aware of its
inferiority to pure math. (I'm only half-joking here.) Instead of doing
something sensible like finishing my physics degree and studying pure 
math as a hobby, I changed my major again. I opted for the
computational math track at CU, which is designed to go with a computer
science minor.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't say I'm any good at math, but I enjoy basking in its crystalline
beauty.
