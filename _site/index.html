      <h1>Salutations.</h1>

<p>
My name is Liam, and unfortunately for you, you've stumbled upon my homepage.
What follows is an unnecessarily long and self-indulgent professional bio, so
if you're not interested in that (understandable), go ahead and check out
my blog, projects, resume, or say hello using the contact page.
</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>
After an interesting (read challenging) childhood and adolescence, I decided
to heed societal expectations and get a post-secondary education. I enrolled
at my local community college and began working toward a degree in biology.
As part of the biology curriculum there I had to take one semester of physics.
My physics professor was truly great, and I was hooked. I changed my major
and signed up for the second semester.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I had to transfer to a four-year school. I ended up going to CU
Boulder to study physics because their financial aid package was the best. 
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>
My first foray into the world of non-everyday computing was using LaTeX
(all hail Donald Knuth) to typeset my community college physics homework.
At first I was using Microsoft Word's god-awful equation editor and I knew
there had to be a better way. I used the Google machine to find LaTeX and I
never looked back.
</p>

<p>
My first baby step into the world of programming was learning to use Vim
to make TeX files instead of using the built-in GUI editor that comes with
MacTeX.
</p>

<h2>Math</h2>

<p>
As I was studying physics at CU, I became increasingly aware of its
inferiority to pure math. (I'm only half-joking here.) Instead of doing
something sensible like finishing my physics degree and studying pure 
math as a hobby, I changed my major again. I opted for the
computational math track at CU, which is designed to go with a computer
science minor.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't say I'm any good at math, but I enjoy basking in its crystalline
beauty.
